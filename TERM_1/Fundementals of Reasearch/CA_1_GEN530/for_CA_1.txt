Introduction : (combined Convolution Neural Network and Long short-term memory Network for detecting covid-19)

- The Covid pandemic that has spread across the world has set all areas on lockdown.
- Finding the covid at starting stage plays an important role to control it before it is highly infectious.
- Numerous analysts have exhibited different ways to deal with identifying Coronavirus using X-ray pictures.
- These days, automatic disease detection has turned into a vital issue in medical science because of fast population development.
- So, Eventually a deep learning based system that combines the CNN and LSTM networks is proposed to automatically detect COVID-19 from X-ray images.
- A dataset is formed comprising 4575 images for developing a model to detect covid-19.
- The LSTM network has an inward memory that is prepared to do learning from basic encounters with long-term states.


Main : (about CNN, LSTM and CNN+LSTM ||| compare with other Networks)
(CNN)
- The fundamental thought behind a CNN is that it can get obtain local features from high layer information sources and move them to lower layers for more complex features.
-  A CNN is a series of convolutional and pooling layers before a fully connected layer.
- The convolutional layer includes a set of kernels for deciding a tensor of feature maps.
- To increase nonlinearity in feature maps, the rectified linear unit (ReLU) layer is utilized.
- ReLU is basically an activation function used to keep the threshold input at zero.
- pooling layer is arranged next to convolution layer used to reduce the size of the input by removing unecessary information to complete the task faster.
- Max pooling is the most common method, which produces the maximum value in an input region.
- FC layer is the final layer which is used to classify the input data into varous categories.

(LSTM)
- Long short-term memory is an improvement of recurrent neural networks
- LSTM proposes memory blocks rather than conventional RNN units in addressing the vanishing and exploding gradient issue
- An LSTM network can recall and connect past data to the data obtained in the present.
- An LSTM is formed with three gates such as a input gate, a 'forget' gate and an output gate
- The forget gate allows the selective passage of data using a sigmoid layer and a dot product
- The output gate determines the states that are required for continuation by the corresponding inputs.
- The final output is obtained and multiplied by the state decision vectors that pass new information through the tanh layer.

(Combined)
- CNN is used for feature extraction and LSTM is utilized to classify COVID-19 dependent on those features.
- This hybrid network (CNN-LSTM) has 20 layers: 12 convolutional layers, five pooling layers, one FC layer, one LSTM layer, and one output layer with the softmax function.
- Every convolution block is joined with a few 2D CNNs and one pooling layer, trailed by a dropout layer described by a 25% dropout rate.
- In the last piece of the design, the function map is moved to the LSTM layer to extract time information.

(Experimental Result for combined)
accuracy_score = 99.2%
Specificity = 99.2%
Sensitivity = 99.3%
F1_score = 98.9%

Conclusion :
- By analyzing the outcomes, it is exhibited that a blend of CNN and LSTM has significant effects on the detection of COVID-19 based on the automatic extraction of features from X-ray images.
- Broad test results uncovered that the proposed design outperforms a competitive CNN Network.
- This architecture has some limitations , the sample size is moderately little that should be expanded to test the generalizability of the created framework
- This would be overcomed if more pictures are found in the coming days
- it just spotlights on the posterior anterior (PA) perspective on X-rays, thus it can't separate different perspectives of X-rays
- Coronavirus pictures including various illness side effects can't be productively classified.
- if this system is compared with radiologists then this prorposed system would have developed more in the future.
